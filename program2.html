    <h3>Leadership Academy</h3>
    <p>Our flagship program empowers youth to discover their leadership potential. Through hands-on workshops, group projects, and real-world challenges, participants develop communication, critical thinking, and decision-making skills.</p>

    <h3>Mentorship Circles</h3>
    <p>We pair youth with mentors who guide them through academic, personal, and career development. Mentors are trained to provide support, encouragement, and access to opportunities that matter.</p>

    <h3>College & Career Prep</h3>
    <p>From résumé writing to mock interviews and college application help, this program prepares young people for life beyond high school. We bring in guest speakers, host campus tours, and provide practical toolkits.</p>

    <h3>Creative Expression Lab</h3>
    <p>A space for young creatives to explore music, art, storytelling, and digital media. This lab celebrates self-expression while helping youth build confidence and share their voices with the world.</p>

    <h3>Community Impact Projects</h3>
    <p>Participants work together to identify real issues in their neighborhoods and design small-scale service projects to create change. These projects promote teamwork, civic responsibility, and empathy.</p>
